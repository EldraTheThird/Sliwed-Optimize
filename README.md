# UPDATE!!!
- Well :/ I would like to correct that I will do 1.19.2 and 1.18.2 first, and I have bad news:  
My PC monitor is broken, and it's still not fixed (2 weeks since it broke) and I'm using an old laptop to continue making modpacks ;-; (i5 5300U, 8GB RAM and 14inch monitor with FullHD resolution)
